# Computer Science Faculty MVC-based Web Application
That is a Computer Science Faculty MVC-based web application. The file structure is into three folder parts. ```public``` is the folder where it is the front controller - ```index.php``` also, there are assets and styles. In the **src** folder are the **Controllers** and **Models** classes. In the view" folder are all the templates. There is an autoloading composer functionality. Also, ```cs_faculty.php``` is the database file that needs to add to your MySQL database. Run the ```composer dump-autoload``` command in your command prompt to generate the necessary files that Composer will use for autoloading.

## Installation
Clone the repository and run the ```composer dump-autoload``` if you test it in a local environment. If you run it in a virtual host on Windows, the application should point to the ```public``` folder to run the front-controller - ```index.php```. The ```index.php``` file needs to be outside the public folder on shared hosting.

## Usage
The application is small, and for that reason, I use tabs on the front-end. The categories are split into **Students**, **Academics**, **Courses** and, **Queries**. It is intuitive to use the application, so it isn't necessary to be verbose.
